This website has been a lifesaver. I used it while taking a bioinformatics class, and it helped me immensely. The site offers video lectures on how to perform basic differential gene expression analysis using R and various biological libraries. The instructor explains concepts so clearly and effectively that even those without a background in bioinformatics can grasp the fundamentals with confidence.

### From the very beginning, the course emphasizes the importance of understanding the why behind each step. Topics include:

•	Pre-course lectures that cover the basics of RNA sequencing and Illumina sequencing technology.

•	Setting up the R/Bioconductor environment, which forms the backbone of the workflow.

•	A detailed explanation of read mapping with Kallisto, including both its practical application and theoretical underpinnings.

Each topic is broken into approximately two-hour lecture units, complete with slides, readings, and videos. Whether you're a self-learner or enrolled as a student, the material guides you from basic sequencing concepts to advanced statistical and reproducibility workflows.

### What truly sets this course apart is the inclusion of live coding labs that utilize real RNA-seq datasets. For example:

•	One of the early labs teaches how to automate read mapping using Bash scripting and loops on subsampled FASTQ files, meaning you can get started without needing access to massive datasets.

•	The labs guide you through working with real-world datasets, including those related to infectious diseases and COVID-19, using provided scripts and instructional support.

•	Beyond bulk RNA-seq, the course also explores single-cell RNA-seq analysis using tools like Seurat, UMAP, clustering, and differential expression techniques.

All materials are structured for step-by-step execution. The site provides scripts, datasets, code, lecture slides, and access to a community forum for support and questions.

### By the end of the course, you’re not just clicking through commands—you’ve actually built the following:

•	A full R/Bioconductor-based RNA-seq pipeline, from raw reads through to differential expression analysis.

•	The ability to automate workflows using shell scripting and version control systems like Git and GitHub.

•	Proficiency in data visualization and analysis tools such as PCA, ggplot2, tidyverse, and functional enrichment analysis, all within reproducible RMarkdown reports.

•	Practical experience in single-cell RNA-seq analysis, including dimensionality reduction, clustering, and annotation.

•	Exposure to modern coding workflows, including the use of AI-assisted tools like GitHub Copilot.

Users on bioinformatics forums often praise the course’s clarity and accessibility. One reviewer wrote, “It’s pretty lengthy… the professor provides code and goes through it line by line with you, plus includes example data.” This kind of practical, guided structure makes the material particularly well suited to hands-on learners.

### This course is especially useful for biologists and aspiring bioinformaticians eager to learn RNA-seq analysis from the ground up. Some key points:

•	No prior experience is necessary—the early modules cover R programming and Unix basics.

•	Be prepared to follow along actively through labs, coding exercises, and optional modules.

•	A capable laptop setup with R, RStudio, Bash, and Git is recommended, and the course provides setup instructions and support.

## Summary
In summary, DIY Transcriptomics is a self-contained, beginner-friendly yet rigorous course. It offers both theoretical depth and practical engagement, guiding learners through the entire RNA-seq analysis pipeline—from learning the core concepts to generating publication-ready results. If you’re ready to begin, check out the early lecture modules and start working through the sample dataset in Lab 2. You might be surprised how quickly you find yourself confident in RNA-seq analysis.
